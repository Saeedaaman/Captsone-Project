# Capstone-Project
Machine Translation of Wakhi Language words into English
The project on Wakhi to English Neural Machine Translation with PyTorch comprises three main sections: Data Preparation and Preprocessing, Neural Network Model Definition and Training, and Model Testing and Evaluation with BLEU Score. In the data preparation phase, the Wakhi to English translation dataset is loaded and processed using Pandas, with words extracted, encoded into integers, and further transformed into one-hot encoded vectors. Vocabulary sizes are determined, and the data is split into training and test sets. The neural network model, TranslationModel, is defined using PyTorch, with two fully connected layers, ReLU activation, and Softmax output. The model is instantiated, and the Cross-Entropy Loss function with the Adam optimizer is employed. Data is converted into PyTorch tensors, and the model is trained with a visual representation of training loss provided. The testing phase evaluates the model using the BLEU score, utilizing functions to translate words individually and compute an average BLEU score for overall model assessment. The README emphasizes clarity, providing a concise overview of the essential steps and functionalities in the Wakhi to English translation project.
